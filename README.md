I decided to give the TES: Legends beta a try, and instantly gravitated towards the Solo and VS Arena game modes, mainly because Arena in Hearthstone is my favorite game mode (not that I'm any good at it).

I found a tier list to help with picks, but did not like the Google Sheet interface. So I decided to try creating something like TheLightforge.

### Features

* Separation of cards based on tier list ranking (0-5 scale)
* Show/hide cards based on attribute & rarity
* Sort cards alphabetically or by name
* Card searching, get up to 3 cards for quick comparison when making picks

### Planned in the future

* Nightmode
* Random UI changes

### Credits

* [The Lightforge](http://thelightforge.com/TierList) & GrinningGoat for all the arena tier list and tips and tricks
* CVH and [Between The Lanes](https://betweenthelanes.net/arena-tier-list/) for the TESLegends tier list
